        <p class="text-right">We know that everybody knows nothing, least of all us, therefore we won’t pretend to
know things, or to seem like something other than what we are: which is passionate about
books, magazines and design.</p>
        <p class="text-right">So with the classic avuncular introduction out of the way, we have some proper explaining
to do. We are not a nefarious oligopoly,instead we area small, dedicated
house that has an ethical bent. We make books, magazines and we also dabble in
merchandise. However, this is not all. We are currently working on an anti-drink spiking
campaign; our purpose is not just to entertain but to interact with the world.</p>
        <p class="text-right">You may not agree that this is what a publishing house should be doing, perhaps we are
not a publishing house, instead, something new.<br/>Anyway, we hope to titillate you with our tales and involve you in our campaigns.

            <h3>Simon Ellice Series</h3>
            <p class="text-center">Written with wry understated British humour; sexy in all the right ways, with a brutal, neo-noir atmosphere that clings to you long after reading. The author is unafraid to play the  writers’ writer at times, but the teasing tempo and laissez-faire attitude to our expectations allow a more casual reader to enjoy on a commute, at a beach bar or however they please.</p>

We have reincarnated it with the help of one of the original members, Bri Nylon of The M.P.s., it is now a fully blown, but still lovable lo-fi, art and music magazine.</p>

            What we need is to make them as accessible as possible and to raise awareness of the kits, hence this is not-for-profit and thus we need your help.</p>
